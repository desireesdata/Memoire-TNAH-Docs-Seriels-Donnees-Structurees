We report observations about languages, named entity types, domains and textual genres studied in the literature. From the start, {NERC} systems have been developed using hand-made rules, but now machine learning techniques are widely used. These techniques are surveyed along with other critical aspects of {NERC} such as features and evaluation methods. Features are word-level, dictionary-level and corpus-level representations of words in a document. Evaluation techniques, ranging from intuitive exact match to very complex matching techniques with adjustable cost of errors, are an indisputable key to progress.},

	title = {Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre-Training},
	url = {https://cdn.openai.com/research-covers/language-unsupervised/language_understanding_paper.pdf},
	abstract = {Natural language understanding comprises a wide range of diverse tasks such as textual entailment, question answering, semantic similarity assessment, and document classiﬁcation. Although large unlabeled text corpora are abundant, labeled data for learning these speciﬁc tasks is scarce, making it challenging for discriminatively trained models to perform adequately. We demonstrate that large gains on these tasks can be realized by generative pre-training of a language model on a diverse corpus of unlabeled text, followed by discriminative ﬁne-tuning on each speciﬁc task. In contrast to previous approaches, we make use of task-aware input transformations during ﬁne-tuning to achieve effective transfer while requiring minimal changes to the model architecture. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a wide range of benchmarks for natural language understanding. Our general task-agnostic model outperforms discriminatively trained models that use architectures speciﬁcally crafted for each task, signiﬁcantly improving upon the state of the art in 9 out of the 12 tasks studied. For instance, we achieve absolute improvements of 8.9\% on commonsense reasoning (Stories Cloze Test), 5.7\% on question answering ({RACE}), and 1.5\% on textual entailment ({MultiNLI}).},

@report{radford_language_2019,
	title = {Language Models are Unsupervised Multitask Learners},
	abstract = {Natural language processing tasks, such as question answering, machine translation, reading comprehension, and summarization, are typically approached with supervised learning on taskspeciﬁc datasets. We demonstrate that language models begin to learn these tasks without any explicit supervision when trained on a new dataset of millions of webpages called {WebText}. When conditioned on a document plus questions, the answers generated by the language model reach 55 F1 on the {CoQA} dataset - matching or exceeding the performance of 3 out of 4 baseline systems without using the 127,000+ training examples. The capacity of the language model is essential to the success of zero-shot task transfer and increasing it improves performance in a log-linear fashion across tasks. Our largest model, {GPT}-2, is a 1.5B parameter Transformer that achieves state of the art results on 7 out of 8 tested language modeling datasets in a zero-shot setting but still underﬁts {WebText}. Samples from the model reﬂect these improvements and contain coherent paragraphs of text. These ﬁndings suggest a promising path towards building language processing systems which learn to perform tasks from their naturally occurring demonstrations.},

Deleting a node u entails removing all edges incident to u and, if u has a parent v, replacing the edge from v to u by edges from v to the children of u. The problem is motivated by the study of query languages for structured text databases. Simple solutions to this problem require exponential time. For ordered trees an algorithm is presented that requires \$O({\textbar}P{\textbar}{\textbar}T{\textbar})\$ time and space. The corresponding problem for unordered trees is also considered and a proof of its {NP}-completeness is given. An algorithm is presented for the unordered problem. This algorithm works in \$O({\textbar}P{\textbar}{\textbar}T{\textbar})\$ time if the out-degrees of the nodes in P are bounded by a constant, and in polynomial time if they are \$O({\textbackslash}log {\textbar}T{\textbar})\$.},
